# COVID19 search engine

Group project assignment for [Text Analysis and Retrieval](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar) course held at
 [University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). <br>

Amid a global crisis caused by COVID-19 pandemic, 
we decided to tackle [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) and make our humble contribution by creating a search engine for
COVID-related information. A total of six versions of search engines are made and evaluated. 

Each model assigns a vector representation to every paragraph in the corpus sorts paragpraph by cosine similarity with generated incoming query vector representation. You can check our [System description paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rdbbhqtqzhdx) for more details.
